What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git files are created when you initialize a repository, allowing it
    to be tracked and ready to use. Without doing this, you cannot commit
    any files or use any git features within it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a temporary location for only the files that you
    want to include in next commit to stay. This allows you to pick and
    choose files that are relevant to a specific change only, without
    altering others in the commit. It also allows you to view what files
    have changed in the status, without having to see all of the others.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    The staging area allows certain files to be added for each commit, which
    allows the user to make combinations of files that only relate to one
    change each. In addition, using the diff commands can help the user to see
    exactly what has changed and remove anything that is not relevant.
