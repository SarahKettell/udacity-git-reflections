When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Using a remote repository is great when you want to share your work with others, 
  either for them to use or edit. It is also useful for group projects where
  multiple people are creating something together. In addition, a remote repository
  creates a backup of your important changes to your project, which are retrievable if
  something happens to your local copy. However, if your project is private or not at
  a stage you are comfortable sharing, keeping it solely on a local repository is
  better.
