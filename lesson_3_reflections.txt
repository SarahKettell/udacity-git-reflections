When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

    Using a remote repository is great when you want to share your work with
    others, either for them to use or edit. It is also useful for group projects
    where multiple people are creating something together. In addition, a remote
    repository creates a backup of your important changes to your project, which
    are retrievable if something happens to your local copy. However, if your
    project is private or not at a stage you are comfortable sharing, keeping it
    solely on a local repository is better.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you have Git pull changes automatically, it is possible that you might
    have a change to your local that you did not want yet. Maybe you are working
    on a new feature or something on a separate branch, but the pull updates the
    branch in a way that messes up your current work.
